Hey, I'm Jake, a Senior Technical Architect.

I love solving problems, writing code, building teams and crafting products people love.

I build systems of people and technology. I'm polyglot with a focus on engineering excellence, which means I like to work with the best tools for the job.

I'm particulaly fond of JavaScript, Java, Swift, Common Lisp, evolutionary architectures, serverless, test driven development, pair proramming, agile principles, Extreme Programming, Amazon Web Services, systems thinking plus a whole lot more.

I have a strong passion for learning, I often have my head in a book, side project, video course or conference talk...
